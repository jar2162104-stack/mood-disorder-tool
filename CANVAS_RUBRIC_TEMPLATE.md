## Criterion 1: Interview Thoroughness (4 points)

| Rating | Points | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Excellent** | 4 | Conducted comprehensive interview with 7+ substantive questions. Covered all key diagnostic areas including: current mood, symptom onset/duration, severity/frequency, functional impairment, sleep patterns, appetite changes, concentration, substance use, medical history, suicidality (if indicated), and family history. Questions were open-ended and clinically appropriate. |
| **Good** | 3 | Conducted thorough interview with 5-6 substantive questions. Covered most key diagnostic areas. Questions were generally appropriate and open-ended. Minor gaps in assessment. |
| **Satisfactory** | 2 | Conducted adequate interview with 4-5 questions. Covered some key areas but missed important diagnostic information. Some questions were too closed-ended or leading. |
| **Needs Improvement** | 1 | Conducted minimal interview with 3 or fewer questions. Significant gaps in assessment. Questions were predominantly closed-ended or not clinically focused. |
| **Insufficient** | 0 | Minimal questioning that failed to gather adequate diagnostic information. Unable to formulate diagnosis based on interview conducted. |

## Criterion 2: Diagnostic Accuracy (4 points)

| Rating | Points | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Excellent** | 4 | Provided correct primary diagnosis with appropriate specifiers (e.g., single episode vs recurrent, severity level, with melancholic/atypical features). Diagnosis aligns perfectly with DSM-5-TR criteria and case presentation. |
| **Good** | 3 | Provided correct diagnosis category with minor errors in specifiers. Diagnosis is substantially correct and appropriate for the case. |
| **Satisfactory** | 2 | Provided related diagnosis within the correct disorder family (e.g., identified mood disorder but selected wrong specific diagnosis). Shows understanding of symptom category. |
| **Needs Improvement** | 1 | Provided incorrect diagnosis but within a related category (e.g., identified anxiety disorder when case presented mood disorder). Some clinical reasoning evident. |
| **Insufficient** | 0 | Provided completely incorrect diagnosis unrelated to case presentation, or no diagnosis provided. |

## Criterion 3: DSM-5-TR Criteria Application (4 points)

| Rating | Points | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Excellent** | 4 | Accurately identifies and applies all relevant DSM-5-TR criteria. Provides specific evidence from the interview for each criterion cited. Demonstrates thorough understanding of diagnostic requirements including duration, severity thresholds, and exclusion criteria. Cites criteria by letter/number when appropriate. |
| **Good** | 3 | Identifies and applies most relevant criteria with supporting evidence from interview. Minor omissions or slight inaccuracies in criteria application. Demonstrates good understanding of diagnostic process. |
| **Satisfactory** | 2 | Identifies some relevant criteria but missing key elements. Provides general evidence but lacks specificity. Shows basic understanding but incomplete application of diagnostic requirements. |
| **Needs Improvement** | 1 | Vague or incomplete criteria citation. Minimal evidence provided to support diagnosis. Demonstrates limited understanding of DSM-5-TR diagnostic process. |
| **Insufficient** | 0 | No criteria cited, or criteria cited are completely inaccurate and unrelated to diagnosis or case. No evidence provided. |

---

## Criterion 4: Differential Diagnosis & Clinical Reasoning (4 points)

| Rating | Points | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Excellent** | 4 | Identifies appropriate alternative diagnoses that should be considered based on symptom presentation. Provides clear, logical rationale for ruling out each alternative. Demonstrates sophisticated clinical reasoning and understanding of diagnostic nuances. Considers medical rule-outs, substance-induced possibilities, and overlapping symptom presentations. |
| **Good** | 3 | Considers relevant alternative diagnoses with reasonable ruling-out process. Clinical reasoning is sound though may miss some subtle distinctions. Shows good understanding of differential diagnosis process. |
| **Satisfactory** | 2 | Mentions some alternative diagnoses but with limited or vague ruling-out rationale. Shows basic understanding of differential diagnosis but lacks depth in reasoning. |
| **Needs Improvement** | 1 | Minimal consideration of alternatives, or alternatives mentioned are not relevant to case. Poor or absent ruling-out rationale. Limited clinical reasoning demonstrated. |
| **Insufficient** | 0 | No differential diagnosis provided, or alternatives listed are completely inappropriate. No clinical reasoning evident. |

---

## Criterion 5: Treatment Plan Appropriateness (4 points)

| Rating | Points | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Excellent** | 4 | Provides comprehensive, evidence-based treatment plan appropriate for the diagnosis. Includes specific therapy modalities (e.g., CBT, IPT, behavioral activation) with rationale. Addresses medication considerations appropriately (general classes, not specific drugs). Includes safety planning if indicated. Considers lifestyle interventions, support systems, and functional goals. Treatment recommendations align with current clinical guidelines. |
| **Good** | 3 | Provides appropriate, generally evidence-based treatment recommendations. Includes therapy and medication considerations. Minor gaps in comprehensiveness or specificity. Recommendations are appropriate for diagnosis. |
| **Satisfactory** | 2 | Provides basic appropriate treatment recommendations but lacking specificity or full evidence base. May be too general (e.g., just "therapy and medication"). Shows understanding of treatment types but limited application. |
| **Needs Improvement** | 1 | Provides vague or partially inappropriate treatment recommendations. May suggest interventions not well-matched to diagnosis. Limited understanding of evidence-based treatments evident. |
| **Insufficient** | 0 | Provides inappropriate treatment plan that does not match diagnosis, or no treatment plan provided. Recommendations could be harmful or show fundamental misunderstanding of treatment principles. |

## Additional Notes for Instructors

### Using the AI Grades

The tool provides suggested scores for each criterion. Use these as a **starting point**:

1. **Quick Review Students (16-20 points / 80-100% range):**
   - Verify AI scores look reasonable
   - Skim their interview and formulation
   - Transfer scores if appropriate
   - Time: 2-3 minutes

2. **Moderate Review Students (12-15 points / 60-79% range):**
   - Review AI scores more carefully
   - Check if ratings are accurate
   - Adjust if needed
   - Provide brief comment on improvement areas
   - Time: 4-5 minutes

3. **Detailed Review Students (<12 points / <60% range):**
   - Thoroughly review entire submission
   - Verify/adjust all rubric scores
   - Provide detailed feedback
   - Consider if student needs additional support
   - Time: 8-10 minutes

### Academic Integrity Notes

Watch for:
- Suspiciously perfect answers that don't match interview quality
- Copy-paste of textbook definitions vs. applied understanding
- Formulations that seem disconnected from their interview

The transcript is your evidence of their actual work.

### Common Adjustment Scenarios

You may want to adjust AI scores when:
- Student showed excellent reasoning but made minor technical errors
- Interview was brief but highly focused and effective
- Treatment plan was creative/appropriate but not "textbook"
- Student's reflection shows deep learning despite imperfect execution
