# ✅ Updated to 20-Point Scale

As requested, I've adjusted the tool to use a **20-point grading scale** instead of 100 points. This makes it a lower-stakes practice assignment perfect for skill development!

## What Changed

### Grading Scale:
- **Before:** 100 points total (20 points per criterion)
- **After:** 20 points total (4 points per criterion)

### Each Criterion Now Worth:
- Interview Thoroughness: **4 points** (was 20)
- Diagnostic Accuracy: **4 points** (was 20)
- DSM-5-TR Criteria Application: **4 points** (was 20)
- Differential Diagnosis: **4 points** (was 20)
- Treatment Plan: **4 points** (was 20)

### Rating Levels:
- Excellent: **4 points** (was 20)
- Good: **3 points** (was 16)
- Satisfactory: **2 points** (was 12)
- Needs Improvement: **1 point** (was 8)
- Insufficient: **0 points** (was 0)

## What This Means for You

✅ **Lower Stakes** - Perfect for practice assignments and formative assessment
✅ **Easy Canvas Setup** - Set assignment to 20 points
✅ **Same Grading Workflow** - AI still provides detailed scores
✅ **Quick to Grade** - Even faster with smaller numbers
✅ **Student-Friendly** - Less intimidating point value

## Letter Grade Conversion

The letter grades now convert as:
- **A:** 18-20 points (90-100%)
- **B:** 16-17 points (80-89%)
- **C:** 14-15 points (70-79%)
- **D:** 12-13 points (60-69%)
- **F:** 0-11 points (<60%)

## Canvas Assignment Setup

When creating your Canvas assignment:

1. Set **Points Possible: 20**
2. Create rubric with **5 criteria at 4 points each**
3. Everything else stays the same!

## Example Export

Students will now see:
```
===== AUTOMATED RUBRIC GRADES =====
Interview Thoroughness: 3/4
Diagnostic Accuracy: 4/4
DSM-5-TR Criteria Application: 3/4
Differential Diagnosis & Clinical Reasoning: 3/4
Treatment Plan Appropriateness: 4/4

TOTAL SCORE: 17/20 (85% - B)
```

## Documentation Updates

All documentation has been updated to reflect the 20-point scale:
- ✅ Main application (App.jsx)
- ✅ README.md
- ✅ INSTRUCTOR_QUICK_START.md
- ✅ STUDENT_GUIDE.md
- ✅ CANVAS_RUBRIC_TEMPLATE.md

## No Changes Needed to Deployment

The deployment process remains exactly the same:
1. Upload files to GitHub
