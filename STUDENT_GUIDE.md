# Student Guide: Mood Disorder Diagnostic Training Tool

## 📱 What Is This?

This is an interactive learning tool that helps you practice clinical psychology skills by interviewing an AI-powered "client" and making diagnostic assessments. It's like a video game simulation, but for psychology!

---

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

By completing this assignment, you'll practice:
- **Clinical Interviewing** - Asking the right questions to gather information
- **Diagnostic Thinking** - Applying DSM-5-TR criteria to real scenarios
- **Differential Diagnosis** - Considering multiple possible diagnoses
- **Treatment Planning** - Recommending evidence-based interventions

---

## 📝 Step-by-Step Instructions

### Before You Start
✅ Review your textbook chapter on mood disorders  
✅ Have your DSM-5-TR criteria sheet handy  
✅ Set aside 30-45 minutes (you can't save and come back)  
✅ Make sure you're on a computer (not phone - you'll need to type)

---

### Step 1: Generate Your Case (2 minutes)
1. Click the link your instructor provided
2. Read the instructions on the welcome page
3. Click **"Generate Unique Client Case"**
4. Wait a moment while your unique case is created

**Remember:** Everyone gets a different case, so don't compare with classmates during the assignment!

---

### Step 2: Interview the Client (15-20 minutes)

You'll see a chat interface. Think of this as your first session with a new client.

**What to Ask About:**
- How long they've been experiencing symptoms
- How severe the symptoms are
- What symptoms they're having (mood, sleep, energy, appetite, concentration)
- How it's affecting their daily life (work, relationships, self-care)
- Any past mental health history
- Medical conditions or medications
- Substance use
- Family history of mental illness
- Thoughts of suicide or self-harm (if relevant)

**Pro Tips:**
- Ask open-ended questions: "Tell me about..." instead of "Do you have..."
- Follow up on interesting responses
- Aim for 5-7 substantial questions minimum
- Be professional - treat this like a real client
- Take notes as they respond!

**Example Good Questions:**
- "Can you describe what your mood has been like recently?"
- "How long have you been experiencing these symptoms?"
- "How is this affecting your daily functioning?"

**Example Bad Questions:**
- "Do you have depression?" (Too direct, not how real interviews work)
- "What's wrong with you?" (Unprofessional)
- "Are you sad?" (Too simple, not diagnostic)

---

### Step 3: Complete Your Diagnostic Formulation (10-15 minutes)

When you're ready to diagnose, click **"Ready to Diagnose"**

You'll fill out a form with:

**1. Primary Diagnosis** (Required)
- Be specific! Include specifiers
- Example: "Major Depressive Disorder, Single Episode, Moderate Severity"
- Don't just write "Depression"

**2. Differential Diagnoses** (Recommended)
- What else could this be?
- Why did you rule those out?
- Example: "Considered Persistent Depressive Disorder, but symptoms only present for 3 months, not 2+ years required"

**3. DSM-5-TR Criteria Evidence** (Recommended)
- List specific criteria and how the client meets them
- Quote what the client said as evidence
- Example: "Criterion A1 (depressed mood): Client reports feeling 'down and hopeless' for past 3 months"

**4. Treatment Plan** (Required)
- Be specific about therapy types
- Mention medication if appropriate (general classes, not specific drugs)
- Include lifestyle recommendations
- Example: "Recommend Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) focusing on cognitive restructuring. Consider SSRI medication consultation with psychiatrist. Encourage regular sleep schedule and light exercise."

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I go back and change my answers after I submit for grading?**  
A: No - treat this like a real clinical session. Once you submit for grading, that's your final formulation.

**Q: What if I get a really hard case?**  
A: That's realistic! Real clients don't present with textbook symptoms. Do your best with the information you gather.

**Q: My friend got a different case. Is that fair?**  
A: Yes! In real clinical practice, every client is different. The grading evaluates your process, not whether you get an "easy" case.

**Q: Can I use my textbook during the interview?**  
A: Absolutely! Real clinicians reference materials. Keep your DSM criteria handy.

**Q: What if the AI client says something confusing?**  
A: Ask follow-up questions! Just like with real clients, it's okay to clarify.

**Q: How long should this take?**  
A: Plan for 30-45 minutes total. Don't rush - thoughtful interviews take time.

**Q: Can I do this on my phone?**  
A: You can, but it's not recommended. You'll be typing a lot, and the full experience works better on a computer.

**Q: What if my internet cuts out?**  
A: Unfortunately, you'll need to start over with a new case. Make sure you have stable internet!

**Q: Are these real clients?**  
A: No - these are AI-generated fictional scenarios for educational purposes only.

**Q: Will my instructor see my entire conversation?**  
A: Yes - your instructor receives the complete transcript as part of your submission.
